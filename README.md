# ALTRNTV-LST
ALTRNTV LST is a todo list app centered around real productivity. 

Lawyers bill their clients in 6-minute increments. To do that, they need to track what they were doing for each of those six minutes. This fine-grained approach to task tracking has incredible productivity benefits we all can adopt.

The problem with most todo lists is they encourage you to collect unfinished todos. This standard system focuses on guilt and creates procrastination.

With ALTRNTV LST you put your focus on tracking what you are doing right now and what you have just done. You rarely pay attention to what you have to do beyond your next action. It is rare to have more than two or three unchecked items. At the end of the day, you should end up with somewhere between 40 and 120 completed tasks.

Normally, you would write what GTD (Get Things Done) calls a project, like "Send Proposal." But when you switch to task tracking you write tasks in what GTD calls an action, "Open Proposal Template." And because you are always writing last action, current action or next action, you end up with a list of very small tasks:

EX:
* open proposal template
* add project details to proposal
* write first draft proposal text
* revise proposal text
_ add in proposal price

# Psychology and Brain Science this approach produces
- Reduces procrastination by making the next action clear.
- Reduces the impact of interruptions by documenting the current context of what you were working on.
- Changes your mindset - It's hard not to think of yourself as productive when you see 100 completed tasks.
- Encourages flow state through sustained focus.
- Induces competitiveness by scoring how many tasks you completed in an hour.

# Track all tasks no matter how small
The core of this system is to approach tasks as very small, easily completed items.
An item like "Write blog post" is way too big to contemplate doing all at once. Writing a blog post might take you an hour or more.
Instead, start with "Open blod editor."
That's it, just open the editor. That's the level of task you should put in.

# Add tasks as you go
The standard way to use a todo list is to add lots and lots of items you are intending to do later in the day.
And then you look at that list and think, "Shoot. How am I ever going to complete all this work?" You will then get distracted and goof off. You have too many choices and too much anxiety. That's bad for productivity.
In this system, you just add one or two tasks at a time at about the point you are actually going to do them. It is normal to have one or two tasks undone.

# Pro Tip: Cheat!
This system includes a virtuous cheating cycle. You are going to be tempted to make your tasks really small so that can claim more completed tasks. Do it!
Small tasks are easier to do. Easier tasks get done quickly. Finished tasks create momentum.
